# LoveMyNeighbor

## Overview
This is a joke program designed to play random noise videos (such as the sound of drilling, banging, walking, etc.) on loop, making it an ideal way to drive your neighbors crazy.

This project was created as my first serious pet project and as a way to have a little fun.
